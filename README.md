# How to run Project along with backend :-
[Frontend](https://github.com/chandanidv03/AnchTestFrontend) and [Backend](https://github.com/chandanidv03/AnchTestBackend) both should be run on same server. if [backend project](https://github.com/chandanidv03/AnchTestBackend) is not running on the `https://localhost:7098/` then you might have to change `apiBaseURL` in [environment.ts](https://github.com/chandanidv03/AnchTestFrontend/blob/main/src/environments/environment.ts#L7) file
